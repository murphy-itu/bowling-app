# African Bowling
A game in which players must throw a piece of wood at 15 pins and try to knock down as many as possible. For each player, the game is divided into 5 frames.

Each frame consists of 3 throws. After each frame, the pins are reset.

If all pins are knocked down with the first throw of a frame, it is called a
strike. If all pins are knocked down after the 2nd or 3rd throw, it is called a spare.


***

## Objectives and features

- Add a new throw with the number of pins knocked down
- View real-time point histories for each frame
